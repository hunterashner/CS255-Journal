CS 255 System Analysis &amp; Design Journal Post

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

For the DriverPass project our client was DriverPass, a new startup looking to offer their clients convenient access to online driving classes, and physical lessons through a convenient and accesible software interface.  I think I did a good job creating diagrams that could be used to create a fluid front-end web interface for DriverPass' student and instructor login portals.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One part of my work I would revise would be the UML class diagram I designed for DriverPass.  I think this diagram could be improved to include more member functions and additional relevant classes to simplify the the the structure of their newly designed web interface.  There is also opprotunity to further abstract these classes, and implement interfaces to simply class structures that are part of an inheritance heirarchy(ex. admins, instructors, receptionist).


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Considering the user's needs is important when dsigning a system because they are who the system is being designed for.  It can be easy for developers and syststem analysts to lose focus of the target user and how their designs can be tailored to offer a better more focused experience for the end user.  This is a great example of why AGILE methodolgies are so important because through multiple iterations of a design, real users can offer input and test the system with an unbiased persepctive of the project.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by jumping straight into development and working on systems that can handle important basic functions of the project before progressing into more technical aspects.  In the future I can utilize many of the system diagrams I had the opprotunity to design in this class to help me organize my projects and prototype systems before taking the effort to jump into software development blindly like I would have previously.
